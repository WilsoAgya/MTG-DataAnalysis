# MTG-DataAnalysis
The objective of this project is to answer the following questions through data-driven findings:

1. Which colour combination decks are the most profitable to build and/or sell with?

2. Which commanders lead to higher deck costs?

3. How does the overall mana-curve of decks differ across each coloured deck?
